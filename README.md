# Mario Game!
This is a game we developed as a final project for our Advanced Programming and Lab course, although the main language of the course was
C++, we went beyond to try a new enviroment specially designed for game development so we used Unity. The objects were mostly gathered
from simply googling the names and our game title, but some of the objects including music are gathered from an online course in game development
from a youtube channel that unfortunaly we've got no clue about the name right now, my contribution was mostly in coding part as a friend of my tryed editing the graphical interface. During development of the code we used also other resources to help us go deep inside the syntax.
